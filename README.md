- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlimeAmetova
- Iâ€™m 31 years old and I am learning Java on my own.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking for an internship to get practical experience and develop my skills.
I am ready to take additional courses if needed to fill any gaps in my knowledge and learn quickly.
If you have any recommendations or advice that can help me improve my skills I will be very grateful for your support.
